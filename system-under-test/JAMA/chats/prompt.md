Metamorphic testing is usually used to check whether the system under test satisfies specific properties. Among them, metamorphic relation is the core concept of metamorphic testing. The metamorphic relation can be considered a formal expression of the properties of the system under test and usually consists of two parts, namely the input relation and the output relation.

For the function $sin(x)$, assuming there is an origin input $x1$, the corresponding origin output is $y1$, $x2$ is a follow-up input, and the corresponding follow-up output is $y2$. $x2$ is transformed from $x1$, and there is an input relation between $x2$ and $x1$: $x2=\pi-x1$, an output relation between $y1$ and $y2$: $y1=y2$. Therefore, there is a metamorphic relation $sin(x)=sin(\pi-x)$.

Based on the above case, please identify the metamorphic relation of this system: There is a function that calculates the determinant of a matrix. The function's name is `det` and comes from JAMA. JAMA is a basic linear algebra package for Java which can be downloaded from [https://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/](https://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/). If a matrix `m` exists, its determinant value can be calculated by `m.det()`. The function's return value is a float number, representing the determinant value of the matrix. Please identify the metamorphic relation of this function as much as possible and output them as java code. Each metamorphic relation should be named test[x], where [x] is the test case number.

Here is an example:

```java
package test;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import java.util.stream.Stream;
import java.util.Random;
import org.junit.jupiter.params.ParameterizedTest;
import org.junit.jupiter.params.provider.Arguments;
import org.junit.jupiter.params.provider.MethodSource;

import Jama.Matrix;

public class JamaExampleTest {
    private Random rand = new Random(System.currentTimeMillis());

    /**
     * Metamorphic Relation 1: The determinant of the matrix is equal to the determinant of the
     * transposed matrix, i.e., det(A)=det(A^T)
     *
     * @param m Source input
     */
    @ParameterizedTest
    @MethodSource("testcaseProvider")
    public void test1(Matrix m) {
        /* Get source output */
        double source_out = m.det();

        /* Construct follow-up input */
        Matrix follow_m = m.transpose();

        /* Get follow-up output */
        double follow_out = follow_m.det();

        /* Verification */
        assertEquals(source_out, follow_out, 1e-6);
    }

    /**
     * Metamorphic Relation 2: The determinant of the matrix multiply a constant equals to the
     * determinant of the matrix which elements in a row multiply the same constant.
     *
     * @param m
     */
    @ParameterizedTest
    @MethodSource("testcaseProvider")
    public void test2(Matrix m) {
        int constant = 3;

        /* Get source output */
        double source_out = constant * m.det();

        /* Construct follow-up input */
        Matrix follow_m = m.copy();
        int k = rand.nextInt(m.getRowDimension()); // Select a row randomly
        for (int i = 0; i < follow_m.getRowDimension(); i++)
            follow_m.set(k, i, follow_m.get(k, i) * constant);

        /* Get follow-up output */
        double follow_out = follow_m.det();

        /* Verification */
        assertEquals(source_out, follow_out, 1e-6);
    }
}
```
