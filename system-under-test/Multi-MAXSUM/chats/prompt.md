Metamorphic testing is usually used to check whether the system under test satisfies specific properties. Among them, metamorphic relation is the core concept of metamorphic testing. The metamorphic relation can be considered a formal expression of the properties of the system under test and usually consists of two parts, namely the input relation and the output relation.

For the function $sin(x)$, assuming there is an origin input $x1$, the corresponding origin output is $y1$, $x2$ is a follow-up input, and the corresponding follow-up output is $y2$. $x2$ is transformed from $x1$, and there is an input relation between $x2$ and $x1$: $x2=\pi-x1$, an output relation between $y1$ and $y2$: $y1=y2$. Therefore, there is a metamorphic relation $sin(x)=sin(\pi-x)$.

Based on the above case, please identify the metamorphic relation of this program: There is a program whose input is an integer array and an integer `m`. The program finds the `m` contiguous mutex subarray with the largest sum and outputs the sum. Please identify the metamorphic relations of this program as much as possible and use Google's C++ testing and mocking framework `googletest` to codify them as C++ code. Here are some examples:

```cpp
/**
 * Metamorphic Relation 1: Adding one integer to the source array, which is identical to
 * one element of the original array, the output should be the same.
 */
TEST_P(FMPInputParamTest, MR1) {
    /* Get source input */
    FMPInput input = GetParam();
    vector<int> source_vec = input.vec;

    /* Get source output */
    int source_out = firstMissingPositive(source_vec, source_vec.size());

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    vector<int> follow_vec = source_vec;
    follow_vec.push_back(source_vec.front());

    /* Get follow-up output */
    int follow_out = firstMissingPositive(follow_vec, follow_vec.size());

    /* Verification */
    EXPECT_EQ(source_out, follow_out);
}

/**
 * Metamorphic Relation 2: Shuffling the elements in the input array, the output will be the same.
 */
TEST_P(FMPInputParamTest, MR2) {
    /* Get source input */
    FMPInput input = GetParam();
    vector<int> source_vec = input.vec;

    /* Get source output */
    int source_out = firstMissingPositive(source_vec, source_vec.size());

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    vector<int> follow_vec = source_vec;
    shuffle(follow_vec.begin(), follow_vec.end(), random_device());

    /* Get follow-up output */
    int follow_out = firstMissingPositive(follow_vec, follow_vec.size());

    /* Verification */
    EXPECT_EQ(source_out, follow_out);
}
```
