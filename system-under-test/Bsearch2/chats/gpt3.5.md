Assume there is a trigonometric function sin(x), a source input x1, and a corresponding source output y1. If follow-up input x2=pi-x1 and corresponding follow-up output y2=y1, we say there is a metamorphic relation sin(x)=sin(pi-x).

Next, you need to identify the metamorphic relation of the function `p`. The specification of this function is as follows:

- The function implements the binary search algorithm to determine whether the specific element occurs in the ascending array.
- The function's input is 2 variables: `vec` and `target`, representing an ascending array and the element to be searched, respectively.
- The function's return value is an integer representing whether `target` occurs in `vec`. If `target` does not occur in `vec`, the function returns 0; otherwise returns 1.
- If elements in `vec` are changed, `vec` must also remain in ascending order.

Please identify the metamorphic relation of this function as much as possible and use Google's C++ testing and mocking framework `googletest` to codify them as C++ code.

Here are some examples:

```C++
/**
 * Metamorphic relation 1: If the target value is already in the array, add an element greater than the max value in array to the end of the array, and the output should be unchanged.
 */
TEST_P(BSearchParamTest, MR1) {
    /* Get input data */
    BSearch2Input input = GetParam();
    vector<int> vec = input.vec;
    int target = input.target;

    /* Get origin output */
    int origin_out = p(vec, target, vec.size());

    if (!origin_out) return;

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    vector<int> follow_vec = vec;
    follow_vec.emplace_back(vec.back() + 1);

    /* Get follow-up output */
    int follow_out = p(follow_vec, target, follow_vec.size());

    /* Verification */
    EXPECT_EQ(origin_out, follow_out);
}

/**
 * Metamorphic relation 2: Multiply all elements in the array and the element to be located by a constant, the output should remain the same.
 */
TEST_P(BSearchParamTest, MR2) {
    /* Get input data */
    BSearch2Input input = GetParam();
    vector<int> vec = input.vec;
    int target = input.target;

    /* Get origin output */
    int origin_out = p(vec, target, vec.size());

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    int constant = 2;
    vector<int> follow_vec = vec;
    for (int& val : follow_vec)
        val *= constant;
    int follow_target = target * constant;

    /* Get follow-up output */
    int follow_out = p(follow_vec, follow_target, follow_vec.size());

    /* Verification */
    EXPECT_EQ(origin_out, follow_out);
}
```

For the binary search function `p`, here are two metamorphic relations that you can use `googletest` to codify in C++:

```C++
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <vector>

// Function implementing binary search
int p(const std::vector<int>& vec, int target, int size) {
    // Implementation of binary search algorithm
    // ...
}

struct BSearchInput {
    std::vector<int> vec;
    int target;
};

class BSearchParamTest : public testing::TestWithParam<BSearchInput> {};

// Metamorphic relation 1: If the target value is already in the array,
// add an element greater than the max value in the array to the end of the array,
// and the output should be unchanged.
TEST_P(BSearchParamTest, MR1) {
    /* Get input data */
    BSearchInput input = GetParam();
    std::vector<int> vec = input.vec;
    int target = input.target;

    /* Get origin output */
    int origin_out = p(vec, target, vec.size());

    if (!origin_out) return;

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    std::vector<int> follow_vec = vec;
    follow_vec.emplace_back(vec.back() + 1);

    /* Get follow-up output */
    int follow_out = p(follow_vec, target, follow_vec.size());

    /* Verification */
    EXPECT_EQ(origin_out, follow_out);
}

// Metamorphic relation 2: Multiply all elements in the array and the element to be located
// by a constant, the output should remain the same.
TEST_P(BSearchParamTest, MR2) {
    /* Get input data */
    BSearchInput input = GetParam();
    std::vector<int> vec = input.vec;
    int target = input.target;

    /* Get origin output */
    int origin_out = p(vec, target, vec.size());

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    int constant = 2;
    std::vector<int> follow_vec = vec;
    for (int& val : follow_vec)
        val *= constant;
    int follow_target = target * constant;

    /* Get follow-up output */
    int follow_out = p(follow_vec, follow_target, follow_vec.size());

    /* Verification */
    EXPECT_EQ(origin_out, follow_out);
}

// You can add more test cases with different inputs as needed

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(Default, BSearchParamTest, testing::Values(
    // Test case 1
    BSearchInput{ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, 3 },
    // Test case 2
    BSearchInput{ {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}, 8 }
    // Add more test cases as needed
));

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
    return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

In this code, `BSearchInput` represents the input structure for the binary search function, and `BSearchParamTest` is a test fixture using `gtest` for parameterized tests. The two metamorphic relations (MR1 and MR2) are implemented as separate test cases. Adjust the test cases according to your specific needs and add more if necessary.

Certainly! Here are two additional metamorphic relations for the binary search function:

```cpp
// Metamorphic relation 3: Reverse the order of elements in the array,
// and the output should remain the same.
TEST_P(BSearchParamTest, MR3) {
    /* Get input data */
    BSearchInput input = GetParam();
    std::vector<int> vec = input.vec;
    int target = input.target;

    /* Get origin output */
    int origin_out = p(vec, target, vec.size());

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    std::reverse(vec.begin(), vec.end());

    /* Get follow-up output */
    int follow_out = p(vec, target, vec.size());

    /* Verification */
    EXPECT_EQ(origin_out, follow_out);
}

// Metamorphic relation 4: Add a constant to all elements in the array
// and to the element to be located, the output should remain the same.
TEST_P(BSearchParamTest, MR4) {
    /* Get input data */
    BSearchInput input = GetParam();
    std::vector<int> vec = input.vec;
    int target = input.target;

    /* Get origin output */
    int origin_out = p(vec, target, vec.size());

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    int constant = 5;
    std::vector<int> follow_vec = vec;
    for (int& val : follow_vec)
        val += constant;
    int follow_target = target + constant;

    /* Get follow-up output */
    int follow_out = p(follow_vec, follow_target, follow_vec.size());

    /* Verification */
    EXPECT_EQ(origin_out, follow_out);
}
```

In these additional test cases (`MR3` and `MR4`), different transformations are applied to the input array before calling the binary search function. `MR3` reverses the order of elements in the array, and `MR4` adds a constant to all elements in the array and to the element to be located. The expected behavior is that the output of the binary search function should remain the same despite these transformations.

Feel free to add more test cases or modify them based on the specific requirements and characteristics of your binary search function.

    std::transform(vec.begin(), vec.end(), vec.begin(),
                   [](int val) { return val * val; });
    int follow_target = target * target;

    /* Get follow-up output */
    int follow_out = p(vec, follow_target, vec.size());

    /* Verification */
    EXPECT_EQ(origin_out, follow_out);
}

// Metamorphic relation 6: Remove the first element from the array,
// and the element to be located is not present in the modified array,
// the output should be 0 (not found).
TEST_P(BSearchParamTest, MR6) {
    /* Get input data */
    BSearchInput input = GetParam();
    std::vector<int> vec = input.vec;
    int target = input.target;

    /* Get follow-up output */
    int follow_out = p(vec, target, vec.size());

    /* Verification */
    EXPECT_EQ(0, follow_out);
}
```

In `MR5`, all elements in the array are replaced with their squares, and the target element is squared as well. The expectation is that the output of the binary search function remains the same.

In `MR6`, the first element is removed from the array, and the target element is not present in the modified array. The expectation is that the output of the binary search function should be 0 (not found).

These additional metamorphic relations provide diverse scenarios for testing the binary search function. Adjust them as needed based on the specifics of your implementation and test requirements.

Certainly! Here are two more metamorphic relations for the binary search function:

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    if (vec.size() >= 2) {
        std::swap(vec.front(), vec.back());
    }

    /* Get follow-up output */
    int follow_out = p(vec, target, vec.size());

    /* Verification */

    /* Get follow-up output */
    int follow_out = p(vec, target, vec.size());

    /* Verification */
    EXPECT_EQ(origin_out, follow_out);
}
```

In `MR7`, the positions of the first and last elements in the array are swapped, and the expectation is that the output of the binary search function remains the same.

In `MR8`, the elements in the array are shuffled randomly, and the expectation is that the output of the binary search function remains the same. Note that `std::random_shuffle` is deprecated in C++14 and removed in C++17, so you may want to use `std::shuffle` with a random number generator if you are using a newer C++ standard.

These additional metamorphic relations introduce more variations in the input array, testing the robustness of the binary search function. Adjust them as needed based on your specific testing requirements.

    int follow_out = p(follow_vec, follow_target, follow_vec.size());

    /* Verification */

```

In `MR9`, a duplicate of the target element is added to the array, and the expectation is that the output of the binary search function remains the same.

In `MR10`, a constant is subtracted from all elements in the array and from the element to be located. The expectation is that the output of the binary search function remains the same.

In `MR21`, the array is shuffled randomly and then sorted in ascending order. The expectation is that the output of the binary search function remains the same.

In `MR22`, the array is reversed and then sorted in descending order. The expectation is that the output of the binary search function remains the same.

These metamorphic relations provide scenarios where the order of the array is changed before applying a sorting operation, testing the binary search function under different input transformations. Adjust them based on your specific testing needs and implementation details.

In `MR45`, the target element is inserted at random positions in the array. The expectation is that the output of the binary search function is 1 (target found) if the array is not empty.

In `MR46`, the array is sorted in descending order, and a new element smaller than the target is added at the end. The expectation is that the output of the binary search function is 0 (target not found) if the array is not empty.

These metamorphic relations provide additional scenarios where modifications are made to the array, affecting the presence or values of the target element. Adjust them based on your specific testing needs and implementation details.

Certainly! Here are two more metamorphic relations for the binary search function:

```cpp
// Metamorphic relation 47: Shuffle the array randomly, and the output should remain the same.
TEST_P(BSearchParamTest, MR47) {
    /* Get input data */
    BSearchInput input = GetParam();
    std::vector<int> vec = input.vec;
    int target = input.target;

    /* Get origin output */
    int origin_out = p(vec, target, vec.size());

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    std::random_shuffle(vec.begin(), vec.end());

    /* Get follow-up output */
    int follow_out = p(vec, target, vec.size());

    /* Verification */
    EXPECT_EQ(origin_out, follow_out);
}

// Metamorphic relation 48: Remove all elements in the array that are smaller than the target,
// and the output should remain the same unless the target was the smallest element.
TEST_P(BSearchParamTest, MR48) {
    /* Get input data */
    BSearchInput input = GetParam();
    std::vector<int> vec = input.vec;
    int target = input.target;

    /* Get origin output */
    int origin_out = p(vec, target, vec.size());

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    vec.erase(std::remove_if(vec.begin(), vec.end(), [target](int val) { return val < target; }), vec.end());

    /* Get follow-up output */
    int follow_out = (target == *std::min_element(vec.begin(), vec.end())) ? 1 : p(vec, target, vec.size());

    /* Verification */
    EXPECT_EQ(origin_out, follow_out);
}
```

In `MR47`, the array is shuffled randomly. The expectation is that the output of the binary search function remains the same.

In `MR48`, all elements in the array that are smaller than the target are removed. The expectation is that the output of the binary search function remains the same unless the target was the smallest element.

These metamorphic relations introduce scenarios where the array is modified by shuffling or removing elements, testing the binary search function's behavior under different transformations. Adjust them based on your specific testing needs and implementation details.

Certainly! Here are two more metamorphic relations for the binary search function:

```cpp
// Metamorphic relation 49: Duplicate all elements in the array and the target element,
// and the output should remain the same.
TEST_P(BSearchParamTest, MR49) {
    /* Get input data */
    BSearchInput input = GetParam();
    std::vector<int> vec = input.vec;
    int target = input.target;

    /* Get origin output */
    int origin_out = p(vec, target, vec.size());

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    vec.insert(vec.end(), vec.begin(), vec.end());
    int follow_target = target;

    /* Get follow-up output */
    int follow_out = p(vec, follow_target, vec.size());

    /* Verification */
    EXPECT_EQ(origin_out, follow_out);
}

// Metamorphic relation 50: Replace all elements in the array with a constant value,
// and the output should remain the same unless the target was the constant value.
TEST_P(BSearchParamTest, MR50) {
    /* Get input data */
    BSearchInput input = GetParam();
    std::vector<int> vec = input.vec;
    int target = input.target;

    /* Get origin output */
    int origin_out = p(vec, target, vec.size());

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    int constant = 42;
    std::fill(vec.begin(), vec.end(), constant);
    int follow_target = (target == constant) ? target : 0; // Set target to constant value if it was already

    /* Get follow-up output */
    int follow_out = p(vec, follow_target, vec.size());

    /* Verification */
    EXPECT_EQ(origin_out, follow_out);
}
```

In `MR49`, all elements in the array and the target element are duplicated. The expectation is that the output of the binary search function remains the same.

In `MR50`, all elements in the array are replaced with a constant value. The expectation is that the output of the binary search function remains the same unless the target was the constant value.

These metamorphic relations introduce scenarios where the array is modified by duplication or replacement of elements, testing the binary search function's behavior under different transformations. Adjust them based on your specific testing needs and implementation details.
