Metamorphic testing is usually used to check whether the system under test satisfies specific properties. Among them, metamorphic relation is the core concept of metamorphic testing. The metamorphic relation can be considered a formal expression of the properties of the system under test and usually consists of two parts, namely the input relation and the output relation.

For the function $sin(x)$, assuming there is an origin input $x1$, the corresponding origin output is $y1$, $x2$ is a follow-up input, and the corresponding follow-up output is $y2$. $x2$ is transformed from $x1$, and there is an input relation between $x2$ and $x1$: $x2=\pi-x1$, an output relation between $y1$ and $y2$: $y1=y2$. Therefore, there is a metamorphic relation $sin(x)=sin(\pi-x)$.

Based on the above case, please identify the metamorphic relation of this system: There is a function that implements the Boyer-Moore algorithm to find the first occurrence index of the string to be searched in the origin string. Its inputs are 2 string variables: `text` and `pattern`, representing the origin string and the string to be searched, respectively. Its return value is an integer representing the first occurrence index of `pattern` in `text`. If `pattern`does not occur in `text`, the function returns -1. Please identify the metamorphic relation of this function as much as possible and output them as java code. Each metamorphic relation should be named test[x], where [x] is the test case number.

Here is an example:

```java
/**
 * Metamorphic Relation 1: Add a string to the end of the origin string, the output of the
 * algorithm should be same or greater.
 *
 * @param text
 * @param pattern
 */
@ParameterizedTest
@MethodSource("testcaseProvider")
public void test1(String text, String pattern) {
    /* Get origin output */
    int origin_res = Boyer.indexOf(text, pattern);

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    String follow_text = text + "xxx";

    /* Get follow-up output */
    int follow_res = Boyer.indexOf(follow_text, pattern);

    /* Verification */
    assertTrue(follow_res >= origin_res);
}
```
