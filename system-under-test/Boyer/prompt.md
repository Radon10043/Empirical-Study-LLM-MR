Assume there are a trigonometric function sin(x), a source input x1 and corresponding source output y1, if follow-up input x2=pi-x1 and corresponding follow-up output y2=y1, we say that there is a metamorphic relation sin(x)=sin(pi-x).

Next, you need to identify the metamorphic relation of a function. There is a function implements the Boyer-Moore algorithm to find the first occurrence index of substring in origin string. Its inputs are 2 string variables: ```text``` and ```pattern```, which represents origin string and substring respectively. Its return value is an integer, which represents the occurrence index of ```pattern``` in ```text```, if ```pattern``` not occurences in ```text```, the function returns -1. Please identify the metamorphic relation of this function as much as possible, and outputs them as text. It should be note that each metamorphic relation should named as MR[x] where [x] is the number of the test case.

Here is an example::

MR1: Add string to the end of the origin string, the output of the algorithm should be the same or greater.

Please generate more different metamorphic relations.
