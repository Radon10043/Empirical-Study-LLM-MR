Assume there are a trigonometric function sin(x), a source input x1 and corresponding source output y1, if follow-up input x2=pi-x1 and corresponding follow-up output y2=y1, we say that there is a metamorphic relation sin(x)=sin(pi-x).

Next, you need to identify the metamorphic relation of a function. There is a function implements the Boyer-Moore algorithm to find the first occurrence index of substring in origin string. Its inputs are 2 string variables: ```text``` and ```pattern```, which represents origin string and substring respectively. Its return value is an integer, which represents the occurrence index of ```pattern``` in ```text```, if ```pattern``` not occurences in ```text```, the function returns -1. Please identify the metamorphic relation of this function as much as possible, and outputs them as text. It should be note that each metamorphic relation should named as MR[x] where [x] is the number of the test case.

Here is an example::

MR1: Add string to the end of the origin string, the output of the algorithm should be the same or greater.

Metamorphic relations (MRs) for the Boyer-Moore substring search algorithm:

MR1: **Addition of String to the End**

- If you append a string to the end of the original string (e.g., text + "additional"), the output of the algorithm should be the same or greater. This is based on the fact that adding characters to the end of the text doesn't affect the position of the pattern within the original text.

MR2: **Addition of String to the Beginning**

- If you prepend a string to the beginning of the original string (e.g., "additional" + text), the output of the algorithm should remain unchanged or increase. Similar to MR1, adding characters to the beginning of the text should not affect the position of the pattern.

MR3: **Reversal of the Original String**

- If you reverse the characters of the original string, the output of the algorithm should remain unchanged. The Boyer-Moore algorithm is not sensitive to the order of characters in the text; it focuses on efficiently skipping unnecessary comparisons based on the pattern.

MR4: **Reversal of the Pattern**

- If you reverse the characters of the pattern, the output of the algorithm should remain unchanged. The Boyer-Moore algorithm is designed to handle pattern reversals efficiently.

MR5: **Replacement of Characters in the Original String**

- If you replace some characters in the original string with different characters, the output of the algorithm should remain unchanged or increase. This is because the Boyer-Moore algorithm is not affected by changes in characters unrelated to the pattern.

MR6: **Replacement of Characters in the Pattern**

- If you replace some characters in the pattern with different characters, the output of the algorithm should remain unchanged. The Boyer-Moore algorithm accounts for variations in the pattern.

MR7: **Empty Pattern**

- If the pattern is an empty string, the algorithm should return 0, indicating a match at the beginning of the text.

MR8: **Empty Text**

- If the text is an empty string, the algorithm should return -1, indicating that no match is found.

MR9: **Multiple Occurrences**

- If there are multiple occurrences of the pattern in the text, the algorithm should return the index of the first occurrence.

MR10: **No Occurrence**

- If the pattern does not occur in the text, the algorithm should return -1.

These metamorphic relations cover various scenarios and transformations that can be applied to the input strings while maintaining the expected behavior of the Boyer-Moore substring search algorithm.

Certainly! Here are additional metamorphic relations for the Boyer-Moore substring search algorithm:

MR11: **Case Insensitivity**

- If you change the case of characters in both the original string and the pattern (e.g., convert all characters to lowercase), the output of the algorithm should remain unchanged. The Boyer-Moore algorithm is case-sensitive, and this metamorphic relation checks if the algorithm can handle case-insensitive searches.

MR12: **Duplicate Occurrences**

- If you duplicate occurrences of the pattern within the original string, the output of the algorithm should remain unchanged, or the index should increase. This is to ensure the algorithm can handle multiple occurrences of the pattern.

MR13: **Partial Overlap**

- If you overlap a part of the pattern with the end of the original string, the algorithm should still find the pattern at the overlapping position. This tests the robustness of the algorithm when the pattern partially extends beyond the end of the text.

MR14: **Remove Characters from the Original String**

- If you remove characters from the original string, the output of the algorithm should remain unchanged or decrease. The algorithm should still correctly locate the pattern even if some characters are removed.

MR15: **Remove Characters from the Pattern**

- If you remove characters from the pattern, the output of the algorithm should remain unchanged or decrease. The algorithm should correctly find occurrences of the modified pattern within the text.

MR16: **Add Special Characters**

MR17: **Pattern as a Prefix of the Text**

- If the pattern is a prefix of the text, the algorithm should return 0, indicating a match at the beginning of the text.

MR18: **Pattern as a Suffix of the Text**

- If the pattern is a suffix of the text, the algorithm should return the length difference between the text and the pattern, indicating a match at the end of the text.

MR19: **Random Shuffling of Characters**

- If you randomly shuffle the characters in both the original string and the pattern, the output of the algorithm should remain unchanged. This tests the algorithm's resilience to arbitrary character arrangements.

MR20: **Repeated Patterns**

- If you repeat the pattern multiple times within the text, the algorithm should return the index of the first occurrence. This checks if the algorithm correctly handles repeated patterns.

These additional metamorphic relations provide a diverse set of scenarios to further test the functionality and robustness of the Boyer-Moore substring search algorithm.
