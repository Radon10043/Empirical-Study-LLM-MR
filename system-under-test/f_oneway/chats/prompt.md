Metamorphic testing is usually used to check whether the system under test satisfies specific properties. Among them, metamorphic relation is the core concept of metamorphic testing. The metamorphic relation can be considered a formal expression of the properties of the system under test and usually consists of two parts, namely the input relation and the output relation.

For the function $sin(x)$, assuming there is an origin input $x1$, the corresponding origin output is $y1$, $x2$ is a follow-up input, and the corresponding follow-up output is $y2$. $x2$ is transformed from $x1$, and there is an input relation between $x2$ and $x1$: $x2=\pi-x1$, an output relation between $y1$ and $y2$: $y1=y2$. Therefore, there is a metamorphic relation $sin(x)=sin(\pi-x)$.

Based on the above case, please identify the metamorphic relation of the `f_oneway` function from `scipy.stats`. The `f_oneway` function performs one-way ANOVA. The one-way ANOVA tests the null hypothesis that two or more groups have the same population mean. Its inputs are 2 groups of data, and its return value is an integer representing the p-value of the two groups of data.

Please identify the metamorphic relations of this system as much as possible and codify them as Python code. Here is an example:

```python
@parameterized.expand(load_test_cases)
def test1(self, g1, g2):
    """MR1: Changing the order of the samples, the result should not change.

    Notes
    -----
    _description_
    """
    # Get origin output
    origin_res = f_oneway(g1, g2).pvalue

    # Construct follow-up input
    follow_g1 = np.random.permutation(g1)
    follow_g2 = np.random.permutation(g2)

    # Get follow-up output
    follow_res = f_oneway(follow_g1, follow_g2).pvalue

    # Verification
    self.assertEqual(origin_res, follow_res)
```
