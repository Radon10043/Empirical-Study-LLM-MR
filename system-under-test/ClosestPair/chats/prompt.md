Metamorphic testing is usually used to check whether the system under test satisfies specific properties. Among them, metamorphic relation is the core concept of metamorphic testing. The metamorphic relation can be considered a formal expression of the properties of the system under test and usually consists of two parts, namely the input relation and the output relation.

For the function $sin(x)$, assuming there is an origin input $x1$, the corresponding origin output is $y1$, $x2$ is a follow-up input, and the corresponding follow-up output is $y2$. $x2$ is transformed from $x1$, and there is an input relation between $x2$ and $x1$: $x2=\pi-x1$, an output relation between $y1$ and $y2$: $y1=y2$. Therefore, there is a metamorphic relation $sin(x)=sin(\pi-x)$.

Based on the above case, please identify the metamorphic relation of this system: There is a system that calculates the distance of the closest pair of points in a set of given points. Its input is a set of points, and its return value is a float number representing the distance of the closest pair of points in the set. In addition, The definition of the struct `Point` is as follows:

```cpp
struct Point {
    int x, y;
}
```

Please identify the metamorphic relations of this system as much as possible and use Google's C++ testing and mocking framework `googletest` to codify them as C++ code. Here is an example:

```cpp
/**
 * Metamorphic relation 1: Add a point to the array, the output should not be larger than before.
 */
TEST_P(ClosestPairParamTest, MR1) {
    /* Get input data */
    ClosestPairInput input = GetParam();
    vector<Point> vec = input.vec;

    /* Get origin output */
    Point *ptr = &vec[0];
    int origin_out = closest(ptr, vec.size());

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    vector<Point> follow_vec = vec;
    follow_vec.push_back({100, 100});

    /* Get follow-up output */
    ptr = &follow_vec[0];
    int follow_out = closest(ptr, follow_vec.size());

    /* Verification */
    EXPECT_GE(origin_out, follow_out);
}
```
