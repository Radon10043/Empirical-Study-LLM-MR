Metamorphic testing is usually used to check whether the system under test satisfies specific properties. Among them, metamorphic relation is the core concept of metamorphic testing. The metamorphic relation can be considered a formal expression of the properties of the system under test and usually consists of two parts, namely the input relation and the output relation.

For the function $sin(x)$, assuming there is an origin input $x1$, the corresponding origin output is $y1$, $x2$ is a follow-up input, and the corresponding follow-up output is $y2$. $x2$ is transformed from $x1$, and there is an input relation between $x2$ and $x1$: $x2=\pi-x1$, an output relation between $y1$ and $y2$: $y1=y2$. Therefore, there is a metamorphic relation $sin(x)=sin(\pi-x)$.

Based on the above case, please identify the metamorphic relation of GNU Grep. Grep searches one or more input files for lines containing a match to a specified pattern. By default, Grep outputs the matching lines. In addition, documentation for Grep is avaliable online, which can be found at [https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html). Please identify the metamorphic relations of this system as much as possible and codify them as Python code. Here are some examples:

```python
@parameterized.expand(load_test_cases)

    """Metamorphic Relation 1: If a character is added to the end of the search term,
    the length of the output length should be the same as or less than the original.

    follow_pattern = pattern + "a"

    # Get follow-up output
