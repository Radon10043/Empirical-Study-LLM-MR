Metamorphic testing is usually used to check whether the system under test satisfies specific properties. Among them, metamorphic relation is the core concept of metamorphic testing. The metamorphic relation can be considered a formal expression of the properties of the system under test and usually consists of two parts, namely the input relation and the output relation.

For the function $sin(x)$, assuming there is an origin input $x1$, the corresponding origin output is $y1$, $x2$ is a follow-up input, and the corresponding follow-up output is $y2$. $x2$ is transformed from $x1$, and there is an input relation between $x2$ and $x1$: $x2=\pi-x1$, an output relation between $y1$ and $y2$: $y1=y2$. Therefore, there is a metamorphic relation $sin(x)=sin(\pi-x)$.

Based on the above case, please identify the metamorphic relation of China Unicom Billing System (CUBS). CUBS is designed to calculate a phone bill based on a plan's type and fee, along with user's talk time and data usage. The source code of CUBS is as follows:

```java
import java.io.IOException;

public class BillCalculation
{

    private String planType = "";

    private int planFee = 0;

    private int talkTime = 0;

    private int flow = 0;

    private int callViewTime = 0;

    private double talkTimePer = 0;

    private double flowPer = 0.3;

    private double viewPer = 0.6;

    private int talkTimeBench = 0;

    private int flowBench = 0;

    private double bill = 0;

    public double phoneBillCalculation( String planType, int planFee, int talkTime, int flow )
