Metamorphic testing is usually used to check whether the system under test satisfies specific properties. Among them, metamorphic relation is the core concept of metamorphic testing. The metamorphic relation can be considered a formal expression of the properties of the system under test and usually consists of two parts, namely the input relation and the output relation.

For the function $sin(x)$, assuming there is an origin input $x1$, the corresponding origin output is $y1$, $x2$ is a follow-up input, and the corresponding follow-up output is $y2$. $x2$ is transformed from $x1$, and there is an input relation between $x2$ and $x1$: $x2=\pi-x1$, an output relation between $y1$ and $y2$: $y1=y2$. Therefore, there is a metamorphic relation $sin(x)=sin(\pi-x)$.

Based on the above case, please identify the metamorphic relation of Aviation Consignment Management System (ACMS). ACMS is intended to provide services related to billing for airlines baggage. It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object. The source code of ACMS is as follows:

```java
public class AirlinesBaggageBillingService
{

    int airClass = 0;

    int area = 0;

    double luggage = 0;

    double benchmark = 0;

    double takealong = 0;

    double luggagefee = 0;

    int tln = 0;

    boolean isStudent = false;

    double economicfee = 0;

    public double feeCalculation( int airClass, int area, boolean isStudent, double luggage, double economicfee )
    {
        this.airClass = this.preairclass( airClass );
        
        this.area = this.prearea( area );
        
        switch (this.airClass) {
        case 0 :
            benchmark = 40;
            break;

        case 1 :
            benchmark = 30;
            break;

        case 2 :
            benchmark = 20;
            break;

        case 3 :
            benchmark = 0;
            break;

        }
        if (this.area == 1) {
            takealong = 7;
            tln = 1;
            if (isStudent) {
                benchmark = 30;
            }
        }
        if (this.area == 0) {
            switch (this.airClass) {
            case 0 :
                tln = 2;
                takealong = 5;
                break;

            case 1 :
                tln = 1;
                takealong = 5;
                break;

            case 2 :
                tln = 1;
                takealong = 5;
                break;

            case 3 :
                tln = 1;
                takealong = 5;
                break;

            }
        }
        if (benchmark>luggage){ 

        	luggage=benchmark;
        }
        return luggagefee = (luggage - benchmark) * economicfee * 0.015;
    }

    public int preairclass( int airClass )
    {
        int result = 0;
        result = airClass % 4;
        return result;
    }

    public int prearea( int area )
    {
        int result = 0;
        result = area % 2;
        return result;
    }
}
```

Please identify the metamorphic relation of this function as much as possible and output them as java code. Each metamorphic relation should be named test[x], where [x] is the test case number. Here are some example:

```java

 * the fee and may decrease it in certain scenarios.
