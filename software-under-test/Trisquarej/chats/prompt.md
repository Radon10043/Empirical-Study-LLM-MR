Metamorphic testing is usually used to check whether the system under test satisfies specific properties. Among them, metamorphic relation is the core concept of metamorphic testing. The metamorphic relation can be considered a formal expression of the properties of the system under test and usually consists of two parts, namely the input relation and the output relation.

For the function $sin(x)$, assuming there is an origin input $x1$, the corresponding origin output is $y1$, $x2$ is a follow-up input, and the corresponding follow-up output is $y2$. $x2$ is transformed from $x1$, and there is an input relation between $x2$ and $x1$: $x2=\pi-x1$, an output relation between $y1$ and $y2$: $y1=y2$. Therefore, there is a metamorphic relation $sin(x)=sin(\pi-x)$.

You are an expert on metamorphic testing. Based on the above case, please identify the metamorphic relation of this system: There is a function that implements an algorithm to identify the type of the triangle and calculate its area. Its inputs are 3 Integer variables: `a`, `b`, and `c`, representing the length of the three sides of the triangle, respectively. Its outputs are 2 values, representing the type of the triangle and the area of the triangle, respectively. Please identify the metamorphic relation of this function as much as possible and output them as java code. Each metamorphic relation should be named test[x], where [x] is the test case number. Here is an example:

```java
/**
 * Metamorphic Relation 1: Add a string to the end of the origin string, the output of the
 * algorithm should be same or greater.
 *
 * @param text
 * @param pattern
 */
@ParameterizedTest
@MethodSource("testcaseProvider")
public void test1(String text, String pattern) {
    /* Get origin output */
    int origin_res = Boyer.indexOf(text, pattern);

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    String follow_text = text + "xxx";

    /* Get follow-up output */
    int follow_res = Boyer.indexOf(follow_text, pattern);

    /* Verification */
    assertTrue(follow_res >= origin_res);
}
```
