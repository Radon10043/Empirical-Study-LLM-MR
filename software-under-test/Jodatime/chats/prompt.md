Metamorphic testing is usually used to check whether the software under test satisfies specific properties. Among them, metamorphic relation is the core concept of metamorphic testing. The metamorphic relation can be considered a formal expression of the properties of the software under test and usually consists of two parts, namely the input relation and the output relation.

For the function $sin(x)$, assuming there is an origin input $x1$, the corresponding origin output is $y1$, $x2$ is a follow-up input, and the corresponding follow-up output is $y2$. $x2$ is transformed from $x1$, and there is an input relation between $x2$ and $x1$: $x2=\pi-x1$, an output relation between $y1$ and $y2$: $y1=y2$. Therefore, there is a metamorphic relation $sin(x)=sin(\pi-x)$.

You are an expert on metamorphic testing. Based on the above case, please identify the metamorphic relation of Joda-Time. Joda-Time is a library designed as a complete alternative to the JDK date and time classes. It includes date, duration, time period and interval classes and has a pluggable API for various calendar systems.  Please identify the metamorphic relation of this function as much as possible and output them as java code. Each metamorphic relation should be named test[x], where [x] is the test case number. Here are some examples:

```java
/**
 * Metamorphic Relation 1: Add the number of days and seconds with the same length of time to
 * the input time, the output will be the same.
 *
 * @param time
 * @param days
 */
@ParameterizedTest
@MethodSource("testcaseProvider1")
public void test1(DateTime time, int days) {
    /* Get source output */
    DateTime source_out = time.plusDays(days);

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    int seconds = days * 24 * 60 * 60;

    /* Get follow-up output */
    DateTime follow_out = time.plusSeconds(seconds);

    /* Verification */
    assertTrue(source_out.equals(follow_out));
}

/**
 * Metamorphic Relation 2: Add the number of weeks and seconds with the same length of time to
 * the input time, the output will be the same.
 *
 * @param time
 * @param days
 */
@ParameterizedTest
@MethodSource("testcaseProvider2")
public void test2(DateTime time, int weeks) {
    /* Get source output */
    DateTime source_out = time.plusWeeks(weeks);

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    int seconds = weeks * 7 * 24 * 60 * 60;

    /* Get follow-up output */
    DateTime follow_out = time.plusSeconds(seconds);

    /* Verification */
    assertTrue(source_out.equals(follow_out));
}
```
