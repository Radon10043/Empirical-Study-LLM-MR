Metamorphic testing is usually used to check whether the software under test satisfies specific properties. Among them, metamorphic relation is the core concept of metamorphic testing. The metamorphic relation can be considered a formal expression of the properties of the software under test and usually consists of two parts, namely the input relation and the output relation.

For the function $sin(x)$, assuming there is an origin input $x1$, the corresponding origin output is $y1$, $x2$ is a follow-up input, and the corresponding follow-up output is $y2$. $x2$ is transformed from $x1$, and there is an input relation between $x2$ and $x1$: $x2=\pi-x1$, an output relation between $y1$ and $y2$: $y1=y2$. Therefore, there is a metamorphic relation $sin(x)=sin(\pi-x)$.

You are an expert on metamorphic testing. Based on the above case, please identify the metamorphic relation of this program: There is a program whose inputs are two strings `s` and `t`, and its return value is an integer representing the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t`. Please identify the metamorphic relations of this program as much as possible and use Google's C++ testing and mocking framework `googletest` to codify them as C++ code. Here are some examples:

```cpp
/**
 * Metamorphic relation 1: Add a character to the end of s, the output should be the same or larger.
 */
TEST_P(DistinctSubsequenceParamTest, MR1) {
    /* Get source input */
    DistinctSubseqenceInput input = GetParam();
    string s = input.s, t = input.t;

    /* Get source output */
    int source_out = numDistinct(s, t);

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    string follow_s = s.append("a");

    /* Get follow-up output */
    int follow_out = numDistinct(follow_s, t);

    /* Verification */
    EXPECT_GE(follow_out, source_out);
}
```
