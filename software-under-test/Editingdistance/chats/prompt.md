Metamorphic testing is usually used to check whether the system under test satisfies specific properties. Among them, metamorphic relation is the core concept of metamorphic testing. The metamorphic relation can be considered a formal expression of the properties of the system under test and usually consists of two parts, namely the input relation and the output relation.

For the function $sin(x)$, assuming there is an origin input $x1$, the corresponding origin output is $y1$, $x2$ is a follow-up input, and the corresponding follow-up output is $y2$. $x2$ is transformed from $x1$, and there is an input relation between $x2$ and $x1$: $x2=\pi-x1$, an output relation between $y1$ and $y2$: $y1=y2$. Therefore, there is a metamorphic relation $sin(x)=sin(\pi-x)$.

You are an expert on metamorphic testing. Based on the above case, please identify the metamorphic relation of this system: There is a system whose inputs are two strings `str1` and `str2`, and its return value is an integer representing the minimum number of operations required to convert `str1` to `str2`.

In addition, three operations are permitted on a string:
- Insert a character
- Delete a character
- Replace a character

Please identify the metamorphic relations of this system as much as possible and use Google's C++ testing and mocking framework `googletest` to codify them as C++ code. Here are some examples:

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Metamorphic relation 1: Add a character to the end of str1, the output should be the same or larger.
 *
 */
TEST_P(EditingdistanceParamTest, MR1) {
    /* Get source input */
    EditingdistanceInput input = GetParam();
    string str1 = input.str1, str2 = input.str2;

    /* Get source output */
    int source_out = edit_dist(str1, str2);

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    string follow_str1 = str1.append("a");

    /* Get follow-up output */
    int follow_out = edit_dist(follow_str1, str2);

    /* Verification */
    EXPECT_GE(follow_out, source_out);
}
```
