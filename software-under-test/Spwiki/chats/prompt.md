Metamorphic testing is usually used to check whether the software under test satisfies specific properties. Among them, metamorphic relation is the core concept of metamorphic testing. The metamorphic relation can be considered a formal expression of the properties of the software under test and usually consists of two parts, namely the input relation and the output relation.

For the function $sin(x)$, assuming there is an origin input $x1$, the corresponding origin output is $y1$, $x2$ is a follow-up input, and the corresponding follow-up output is $y2$. $x2$ is transformed from $x1$, and there is an input relation between $x2$ and $x1$: $x2=\pi-x1$, an output relation between $y1$ and $y2$: $y1=y2$. Therefore, there is a metamorphic relation $sin(x)=sin(\pi-x)$.

You are an expert on metamorphic testing. Based on the above case, please identify the metamorphic relation of this program: There is a program that implements the Dijkstra algorithm to calculate the shortest distance between two vertices. Its input is a two-dim integer array `edges` and three integers `src`, `dst`, and `n`. Among them, `edges[i] = {s, e, w}` indicates that there is an undirected edge from `s` to `e` in the graph,  and the weight of the edge is `w`. `src`, `dst`, `n` indicates the source vertex, the destination vertex, and the number of vertices in the graph, respectively. Its output is an integer representing the shortest distance from `src` to `dst`. Please identify the metamorphic relations of this program as much as possible and use Google's C++ testing and mocking framework `googletest` to codify them as C++ code. Here are some examples:

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Metamorphic Relation 1: Reversing the source and destination vertices, the length of the shortest path should be the same.
 *
 */
TEST_P(SpwikiParamTest, MR1) {
    /* Get source input */
    SpwikiInput input = GetParam();
    vector<vector<int>> source_edges = input.edges;
    int source_src = input.src, source_dst = input.dst, source_n = input.n;

    /* Get source output */
    int source_out = shortest_path(source_edges, source_src, source_dst, source_n);

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    int follow_src = source_dst, follow_dst = source_src;

    /* Get follow-up output */
    int follow_out = shortest_path(source_edges, follow_src, follow_dst, source_n);

    /* Verification */
    EXPECT_EQ(follow_out, source_out);
}

/**
 * @brief Metamorphic Relation 2: Doubling the weight of each edge, the length of the shortest path should be doubled.
 *
 */
TEST_P(SpwikiParamTest, MR2) {
    /* Get source input */
    SpwikiInput input = GetParam();
    vector<vector<int>> source_edges = input.edges;
    int source_src = input.src, source_dst = input.dst, source_n = input.n;

    /* Get source output */
    int source_out = shortest_path(source_edges, source_src, source_dst, source_n);

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    vector<vector<int>> follow_edges = source_edges;
    for (auto &elem : follow_edges)
        elem[2] *= 2;

    /* Get follow-up output */
    int follow_out = shortest_path(follow_edges, source_src, source_dst, source_n);

    /* Verification */
    EXPECT_EQ(follow_out, source_out * 2);
}
```
