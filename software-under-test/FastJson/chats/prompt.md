Metamorphic testing is usually used to check whether the software under test satisfies specific properties. Among them, metamorphic relation is the core concept of metamorphic testing. The metamorphic relation can be considered a formal expression of the properties of the software under test and usually consists of two parts, namely the input relation and the output relation.

For the function $sin(x)$, assuming there is an origin input $x1$, the corresponding origin output is $y1$, $x2$ is a follow-up input, and the corresponding follow-up output is $y2$. $x2$ is transformed from $x1$, and there is an input relation between $x2$ and $x1$: $x2=\pi-x1$, an output relation between $y1$ and $y2$: $y1=y2$. Therefore, there is a metamorphic relation $sin(x)=sin(\pi-x)$.

You are an expert on metamorphic testing. Based on the above case, please identify the metamorphic relation of fastjson. Fastjson is a Java library developed by alibaba, it can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object. Fastjson can work with arbitrary Java objects including pre-existing objects that you do not have source-code of. Please identify the metamorphic relation of this function as much as possible and output them as java code. Each metamorphic relation should be named test[x], where [x] is the test case number. Here are some examples:

```java
/**
 * Metamorphic Relation 1: The input is a hash table. Converting the hash table
 * into string s1, after adding a piece of data to the hash table and converting
 * it into string s2, the length of s2 is greater than s1.
 *
 * @param source_in
 */
@ParameterizedTest
@MethodSource("testcaseProvider1")
public void test1(HashMap<Object, Object> source_in) {
    /* Get source output */
    String source_out = JSON.toJSONString(source_in);

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    HashMap<Object, Object> follow_in = new HashMap<Object, Object>();
    follow_in.putAll(source_in);
    follow_in.put("foo", "bar");

    /* Get follow-up output */
    String follow_out = JSON.toJSONString(follow_in);

    /* Verification */
    assertTrue(follow_out.length() > source_out.length());
}

/**
 * Metamorphic Relation 2: The input is a string representing the JSON file's
 * content. Adding a comment to the string, the parse result of the string will
 * be the same.
 *
 * @param source_in
 */
@ParameterizedTest
@MethodSource("testcaseProvider2")
public void test2(String source_in) {
    /* Get source output */
    Object source_out = JSON.parseObject(source_in);

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    String follow_in = source_in + "/* Comment comment comment */";

    /* Get follow-up output */
    Object follow_out = JSON.parseObject(follow_in);

    /* Verification */
    assertEquals(source_out, follow_out);
}

/**
 * Metamorphic Relation 3: The input is a hash table. Swapping the value of a
 * pair of key and value and converting the hash table to the string, the output
 * length will be the same.
 *
 * @param source_in
 */
@ParameterizedTest
@MethodSource("testcaseProvider1")
public void test3(HashMap<Object, Object> source_in) {
    /* Get source output */
    String source_out = JSON.toJSONString(source_in);

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    HashMap<Object, Object> follow_in = new HashMap<Object, Object>();
    follow_in.putAll(source_in);
    Iterator<Object> it = follow_in.keySet().iterator();
    Object k = it.next();
    Object v = follow_in.get(k);
    follow_in.remove(k);
    follow_in.put(v, k);

    /* Get follow-up output */
    String follow_out = JSON.toJSONString(follow_in);

    /* Verification */
    assertEquals(source_out.length(), follow_out.length());
}
```
