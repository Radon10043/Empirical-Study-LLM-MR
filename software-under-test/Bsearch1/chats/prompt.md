Metamorphic testing is usually used to check whether the software under test satisfies specific properties. Among them, metamorphic relation is the core concept of metamorphic testing. The metamorphic relation can be considered a formal expression of the properties of the software under test and usually consists of two parts, namely the input relation and the output relation.

For the function $sin(x)$, assuming there is an origin input $x1$, the corresponding origin output is $y1$, $x2$ is a follow-up input, and the corresponding follow-up output is $y2$. $x2$ is transformed from $x1$, and there is an input relation between $x2$ and $x1$: $x2=\pi-x1$, an output relation between $y1$ and $y2$: $y1=y2$. Therefore, there is a metamorphic relation $sin(x)=sin(\pi-x)$.

You are an expert on metamorphic testing. Based on the above case, please identify the metamorphic relation of this system: There is a function that implements the algorithm to find the starting and ending indexes of the target number in the array. Its inputs are 2 variables: `vec` and `target`, representing an ascending array and the element to be searched, respectively. Its return value is an integer array whose length is always two. Among them, the first and second integers are the starting and ending index of `target` in `vec`, respectively. If `target` does not occur in `vec`, the function returns {-1,-1}. Please identify the metamorphic relation of this function as much as possible and use Google's C++ testing and mocking framework `googletest` to codify them as C++ code. Here are some examples:

```C++
/**
 * @brief Metamorphic relation 1: Increasing the searching number by 1, if the original searching and this new searching number are both in the array, then the
 * starting position of the new number should be larger by 1 than the ending position of the original number.
 *
 */
TEST_P(GetRangeParamTest, MR1) {
    /* Get source input */
    GetRangeInput input = GetParam();
    vector<int> vec = input.vec;
    int target = input.target;

    /* Get source output */
    vector<int> source_out = get_range(vec, target);

    if (source_out[0] == -1 && source_out[1] == -1)
        return;

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    int follow_target = target + 1;

    /* Get follow-up output */
    vector<int> follow_out = get_range(vec, follow_target);

    /* Verification */
    EXPECT_LE(source_out[1] + 1, follow_out[0]);
}

/**
 * @brief Metamorphic relation 2: Adding one small number to the head of the array, then the index of the searching number should also be increased by 1 (both
 * the starting and ending positions) if it is contained in the array.
 */
TEST_P(GetRangeParamTest, MR2) {
    /* Get source input */
    GetRangeInput input = GetParam();
    vector<int> vec = input.vec;
    int target = input.target;

    /* Get source output */
    vector<int> source_out = get_range(vec, target);

    if (source_out[0] == -1 && source_out[1] == -1)
        return;

    /* Construct follow-up input */
    vector<int> follow_vec = vec;
    follow_vec.insert(follow_vec.begin(), follow_vec.front() - 1);

    /* Get follow-up output */
    vector<int> follow_out = get_range(follow_vec, target);

    /* Verification */
    EXPECT_EQ(source_out[0] + 1, follow_out[0]);
    EXPECT_EQ(source_out[1] + 1, follow_out[1]);
}
```
