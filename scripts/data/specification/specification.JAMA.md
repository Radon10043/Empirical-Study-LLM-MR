> The `det()` function in the JAMA (Java Matrix Algebra) library is a method used to calculate the determinant of a square matrix. JAMA is a package designed for linear algebra computations and provides a wide range of functionalities for operations on matrices, including solving linear equations, eigenvalue computation, singular value decomposition, and more.
>
> ### Function Signature
> The `det()` method does not have parameters and is called on a `Matrix` object:
> ```java
> public double det()
> ```
>
> ### Usage
> To use the `det()` method, you first need to create an instance of the `Matrix` class representing the square matrix for which you want to find the determinant. After the matrix is instantiated, you can call the `det()` method on this instance.
>
> ### Parameters
> - The `det()` method does not take any parameters. It operates on the `Matrix` object on which it is called.
>
> ### Returns
> - **Type**: `double`
> - **Description**: The method returns the determinant of the matrix. If the matrix is not square, the behavior is not defined in the specification, but typically, a square matrix is required for determinant computation.
>
> ### Notes
> - The matrix must be square (i.e., the number of rows equals the number of columns). The method's behavior for non-square matrices is not specified, but generally, determinant computation is only applicable to square matrices.
> - JAMA is designed to be simple and provide sufficient functionality for many applications in linear algebra. It may not be as comprehensive or efficient as some other libraries but serves well for educational and straightforward computational purposes.
> - Ensure that the JAMA library is correctly added to your project's classpath to use the `Matrix` class and its methods.
>
> ### Dependencies
> - JAMA library: The `det()` function is part of the JAMA library, so this library must be included in your project to use this function.
