> ### `phoneBillCalculation` Function Specification
>
> #### Description
> The `phoneBillCalculation` method calculates the monthly phone bill based on a user's plan type, plan fee, talk time, and data usage (flow). The calculation considers various thresholds for talk time and data usage specific to different plan types and fees, applying additional charges if these thresholds are exceeded.
>
> #### Signature
> ```java
> public double phoneBillCalculation(String planType, int planFee, int talkTime, int flow)
> ```
>
> #### Parameters
> - `planType` (`String`): The type of the phone plan, which can be "A" or "B" (case-insensitive).
> - `planFee` (`int`): The base fee of the chosen plan.
> - `talkTime` (`int`): The total talk time in minutes used by the subscriber in the billing period.
> - `flow` (`int`): The total data usage in MB used by the subscriber in the billing period.
>
> #### Returns
> - `double`: The total monthly bill for the subscriber, including the plan fee and any extra charges for exceeding the talk time and data usage thresholds.
>
> #### Logic
> 1. **Setting Benchmarks and Rates**: Based on the `planType` and `planFee`, the method sets the benchmarks for free talk time (`talkTimeBench`) and data usage (`flowBench`), as well as the per-minute rate (`talkTimePer`) for additional talk time and a fixed rate (`flowPer`) for additional data usage.
> 2. **Plan Type A and B**:
>    - For plan A, different `planFee` options provide various `talkTimeBench`, `flowBench`, and `talkTimePer` values.
>    - For plan B, different `planFee` options similarly adjust these benchmarks and rates.
> 3. **Calculation**: The bill is calculated as follows:
>    - If the actual talk time or flow is less than the benchmark, the benchmark value is used for calculation.
>    - The total bill includes the base `planFee` plus extra charges for talk time and data usage that exceed their respective benchmarks, calculated using the rates `talkTimePer` and `flowPer`.
> 4. **Exception Handling**: The method includes logic to throw an `IOException` for invalid `planFee` or `planType`, but it does not actually throw the exception; instead, it instantiates a new `IOException` without affecting the program flow.
>
> #### Notes
> - The method does not correctly handle invalid `planType` or `planFee` inputs as it creates `IOException` objects without throwing them, which means these errors do not affect the execution or output.
> - The method assumes that `planType` is provided correctly and will not calculate the bill accurately if an invalid `planType` or `planFee` is provided.
> - The code provided in the `main` method is an example of how to call the `phoneBillCalculation` method and print the result.
