> ### Program Name: TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoidance System)
>
> ### Description
> The TCAS program is a simplified simulation of an airborne collision avoidance system. It makes decisions on whether an aircraft should climb or descend to avoid another aircraft based on various parameters such as altitude, vertical separation, and the intentions of the other aircraft.
>
> ### Functionality
> - **Collision Avoidance**: Determines whether an upward or downward resolution advisory (RA) is needed to avoid a potential collision.
> - **Vertical Separation**: Analyzes the current vertical separation between the own aircraft and another aircraft to suggest avoidance maneuvers.
> - **Resolution Advisory**: Provides advisories based on the situation: UNRESOLVED (no advisory), UPWARD_RA (climb), or DOWNWARD_RA (descend).
>
> ### Key Components
> - **Vertical Separation Variables**: Tracks the current vertical separation and the altitude rates of both the own and other aircraft.
> - **Separation Thresholds**: Uses predefined altitude thresholds to decide on advisories.
> - **State Variables**: Maintains states such as the other aircraft's climb or descend intentions and capabilities (TCAS equipped or not).
>
> ### Main Functions
> - `initialize()`: Initializes altitude thresholds for positive resolution advisories.
> - `ALIM()`: Determines the altitude limit for providing a resolution advisory.
> - `Inhibit_Biased_Climb()`: Decides whether to inhibit climbing based on the climb inhibit flag and current separation.
> - `Non_Crossing_Biased_Climb()`, `Non_Crossing_Biased_Descend()`: Determine if non-crossing climb or descend advisories should be issued based on current separation and altitude limits.
> - `Own_Below_Threat()`, `Own_Above_Threat()`: Check if the own aircraft is below or above the other aircraft that poses a threat.
> - `alt_sep_test()`: Main logic for deciding the type of resolution advisory to issue based on the situation.
> - `main()`: Entry point of the program, processing command-line arguments as input parameters and printing the advisory decision.
>
> ### Input Parameters
> - `Cur_Vertical_Sep`: Current vertical separation between the own and the other aircraft.
> - `High_Confidence`: Indicates if the altitude measurement is reliable.
> - `Two_of_Three_Reports_Valid`: Indicates if at least two out of three altitude reports are valid.
> - `Own_Tracked_Alt`, `Own_Tracked_Alt_Rate`, `Other_Tracked_Alt`: Altitudes and altitude rate of the own aircraft and the other aircraft.
> - `Alt_Layer_Value`: The current altitude layer value of the own aircraft.
> - `Up_Separation`, `Down_Separation`: The current upward and downward separation from the other aircraft.
> - `Other_RAC`: The resolution advisory command from the other aircraft (NO_INTENT, DO_NOT_CLIMB, DO_NOT_DESCEND).
> - `Other_Capability`: Indicates if the other aircraft is TCAS equipped.
> - `Climb_Inhibit`: Indicates if climbing is temporarily inhibited.
>
> ### Output
> The program prints the resolution advisory as an integer: `0` for UNRESOLVED, `1` for UPWARD_RA, or `2` for DOWNWARD_RA.
