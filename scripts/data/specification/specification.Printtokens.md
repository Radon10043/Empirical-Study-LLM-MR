> ### Program Specification: `print_tokens`
>
> #### Purpose
> The `print_tokens` program is designed to read input text and separate it into a series of tokens based on predefined rules. It identifies different types of tokens such as keywords, numeric values, special characters, and constants.
>
> #### Functions and Key Components
> - **Numeric Case Handling**: Processes numeric tokens, ensuring they conform to the expected format.
> - **Error or EOF Case Handling**: Manages scenarios where an error is encountered in the input stream or the end of the file (EOF) is reached.
> - **Delimiter Checking**: Identifies if a character acts as a delimiter, marking the boundary between tokens.
> - **Keyword Identification**: Determines if a series of characters matches any predefined keywords.
> - **Special Character Handling**: Processes special characters, which may include symbols with specific meanings in the context of the input.
> - **Character Skipping**: Advances the character stream pointer to bypass irrelevant or whitespace characters.
> - **Constant Processing**: Handles constants, possibly including string literals or predefined values.
> - **State Management**: Determines the next state in a state machine, likely used to control the flow of tokenization.
> - **Token Extraction**: Retrieves the actual token from the input stream based on the current state and processing rules.
>
> #### Input and Output
> - **Input**: The program accepts input from a file or standard input stream, containing text to be tokenized.
> - **Output**: Outputs a series of tokens, each identified according to the program's rules.
>
> #### Implementation Details
> - The program includes a `main` function, suggesting it's designed to be executed from the command line with arguments (`argc` and `argv`), possibly for specifying input files or options.
> - It uses a mix of static functions for internal processing and possibly relies on an external library or module `tokens.h` for additional functionality or definitions.
>
> #### Usage
> To use the program, compile it with a C compiler and run it from the command line, potentially with arguments specifying input files or options. The exact usage details would be clearer upon reviewing the complete implementation, including the `main` function's argument handling and the program's overall logic flow.
