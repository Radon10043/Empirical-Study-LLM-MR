> ### Program Specification: `print_tokens2`
>
> #### Purpose
> The `print_tokens2` program is designed to tokenize input from a specified file and print out the resulting token stream. This process involves parsing the file's contents to identify and separate tokens according to predefined rules and structures.
>
> #### Input
> - **Filename**: The program expects a single input: the name of the file to be tokenized. This file should contain the text to be processed.
>
> #### Output
> - **Token Stream**: The program prints out the stream of tokens identified within the input file. Each token is printed separately, likely with delineation to indicate the token boundaries or types.
>
> #### Description and Functionality
> - **Tokenizer Interface**: The program utilizes a tokenizer interface, suggesting that it relies on a set of functions or a library designed specifically for breaking down text into tokens. These tokens can be words, symbols, or other elements defined by the tokenizer's rules.
> - **Token Types**: Typical tokens include identifier, keyword, string, numeric, and character.
> - **Error Handling**: The program include error handling mechanisms to deal with issues such as file not found, unreadable content, or unsupported token types.
