> ### `maximalRectangle` Function Specification
>
> #### Description
> The `maximalRectangle` function calculates the area of the largest rectangle containing all ones in a 2D binary matrix.
>
> #### Function Signature (Java)
> ```java
> public static int maximalRectangle(ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> a)
> ```
>
> #### Parameters
> - `a`: An `ArrayList` of `ArrayList` of `Integer` representing a 2D binary matrix, where each element is either `0` or `1`.
>
> #### Returns
> - `int`: The area of the largest rectangle containing only `1`s in the given matrix.
>
> #### Logic
> 1. **Preprocess the Matrix**: First, the function preprocesses the matrix to compute the height of the histogram representation of each row. For each cell in the matrix (`s[i][j]`), if the cell contains `1`, it stores the number of consecutive `1`s seen so far in that column up to row `i`. If the cell contains `0`, it resets the count to `0`.
>
> 2. **Largest Rectangle in Histogram**: For each row in the processed matrix, it calculates the largest rectangle area that can be formed in the histogram represented by that row. This is achieved by the `largestRectangleArea` helper function.
>
> 3. **Maximum Area**: It keeps track of the maximum area encountered while processing each row's histogram.
>
> #### Helper Function: `largestRectangleArea`
> - **Description**: Calculates the largest rectangle area in a histogram.
> - **Signature**: `public static int largestRectangleArea(int[] heights)`
> - **Parameters**:
>     - `heights`: An array of integers where each integer represents the height of a histogram bar.
> - **Returns**: The area of the largest rectangle that can be formed in the histogram.
>
> #### Algorithm for `largestRectangleArea`
> 1. **Stack**: Uses a stack to keep track of the indices of the bars.
> 2. **Iteration**: Iterates through each bar in the histogram:
>     - While the current bar's height is less than the height of the bar at the top of the stack, it calculates the area of the rectangle with the stack's top as the smallest bar (height) and pops from the stack. The width of the rectangle is calculated based on the current index `i` and the new top of the stack after the pop.
>     - If the current bar's height is greater than or equal to the height of the bar at the top of the stack, it pushes the current index onto the stack.
> 3. **Remaining Bars**: After processing all bars, it calculates the area for the remaining bars in the stack.
> 4. **Maximum Area**: Keeps track of and returns the maximum area encountered.
>
> #### Notes
> - The function effectively transforms the problem into multiple "Largest Rectangle in Histogram" problems, one for each row of the matrix.
> - This approach leverages the stack data structure for efficient computation of the largest rectangle in a histogram.
> - The solution is optimized for performance but assumes the input matrix is non-empty and well-formed (i.e., all rows are of equal length).
