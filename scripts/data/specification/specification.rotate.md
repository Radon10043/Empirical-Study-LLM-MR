> The `rotate` function from the `scipy.ndimage` module in Python is designed for rotating an array by a specified angle. It is part of the `scipy.ndimage` package, which provides a plethora of functions for multidimensional image processing.
>
> ### Function Signature
> The function signature for `rotate` is as follows:
> ```python
> scipy.ndimage.rotate(input, angle, axes=(1, 0), reshape=True, output=None, order=3, mode='constant', cval=0.0, prefilter=True)
> ```
>
> ### Parameters
> - **`input`** : array_like
>     - The input array to be rotated.
> - **`angle`** : float
>     - The rotation angle in degrees, counter-clockwise.
> - **`axes`** : tuple of 2 ints, optional
>     - The two axes around which to rotate the array. Default is `(1, 0)`, which rotates the array in the plane of the first two axes.
> - **`reshape`** : bool, optional
>     - If `True` (default), the output shape is adapted so that the input array is contained completely in the output. If `False`, the output shape is the same as the input shape.
> - **`output`** : array or dtype, optional
>     - The array in which to place the output, or the dtype of the returned array.
> - **`order`** : int, optional
>     - The order of the spline interpolation used to rotate the image. The default is `3`. Options are `0`-`5`.
> - **`mode`** : {'constant', 'nearest', 'reflect', 'mirror', 'wrap'}, optional
>     - The mode parameter determines how the input array is extended beyond its boundaries. Default is `'constant'`.
> - **`cval`** : scalar, optional
>     - The value to fill past edges of the input if `mode` is `'constant'`. Default is `0.0`.
> - **`prefilter`** : bool, optional
>     - If `True` (the default), the function pre-filters the input array with a spline filter before rotating. If `False`, no pre-filtering is applied.
>
> ### Returns
> - **`return`** : ndarray
>     - The rotated array.
>
> ### Description
> The `rotate` function rotates the `input` array around the specified `axes` by the `angle` degrees counter-clockwise. The rotation is performed using spline interpolation of the requested order. The array can be padded with zeros or other specified values (`cval`) outside the boundaries, depending on the `mode` specified.
>
> ### Notes
> - The function can handle arrays of any dimensionality, but the rotation is performed in the plane defined by the `axes`. For 3D or higher-dimensional arrays, this means the rotation can be applied in planes slicing through the array.
> - The quality of the rotation depends on the `order` of the spline interpolation, with higher orders providing better quality but requiring more computation time.
> - When `reshape` is `True`, the output array might have a different shape from the input array to ensure that the rotated array fits entirely within the output array.
> - The function is part of the `scipy.ndimage` package, which contains many functions for multidimensional image processing beyond rotation, such as filtering, morphology, and feature detection.
