> ### `shortest_superstring` Function Specification
>
> #### Description
> The `shortest_superstring` function computes the shortest superstring from a given set of strings. A superstring is defined as a single string that contains each of the given strings as a substring. The goal of this function is to concatenate the given strings in such a way that the resulting superstring is as short as possible, by maximizing the overlap between the strings.
>
> #### Function Signature
> ```java
> public static String shortest_superstring(ArrayList<String> arr)
> ```
>
> #### Parameters
> - `arr`: An `ArrayList<String>` containing the set of strings for which the shortest superstring is to be found.
>
> #### Returns
> - The function returns a `String` that represents the shortest superstring encompassing all strings in the input `ArrayList`.
>
> #### Methodology
> 1. **Convert ArrayList to Array**: Converts the input `ArrayList<String>` into an array of strings to facilitate processing with the `shortestSuperstring` function.
>
> 2. **Calculate Overlaps**: Computes the pairwise overlaps between all strings in the set. For each pair of strings `(A[i], A[j])`, it calculates the maximum overlap where `A[i]` ends with a substring that `A[j]` starts with.
>
> 3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**:
>     - Utilizes a DP approach where `dp[mask][i]` keeps track of the maximum overlap obtained by considering a set of strings represented by `mask` and ending with the `i`-th string.
>     - `mask` is a bit mask with `N` bits (`N` being the number of strings), where each bit represents the inclusion (1) or exclusion (0) of a string in the set.
>     - For each subset of strings and for every possible ending string, the function calculates the maximum overlap by considering all strings that could come before the ending string in the superstring.
>
> 4. **Reconstructing the Shortest Superstring**:
>     - Determines the order (`perm`) in which to concatenate the strings to achieve the shortest superstring by following the `parent` pointers in the DP table.
>     - Starts from the string that, when placed last, contributes to the maximum overall overlap, and traces back through the `parent` array to determine the optimal order.
>     - Reverses the determined order (`perm`) as the final concatenation sequence.
>
> 5. **Building the Superstring**:
>     - Constructs the superstring by starting with the first string in the determined order and appending each subsequent string minus the overlapping part with the preceding string.
>
> #### Notes
> - This problem, known as the Shortest Common Supersequence problem, is NP-hard, which means there is no known polynomial-time solution for finding the absolute shortest superstring.
> - The provided implementation uses a greedy approximation algorithm, employing dynamic programming to find a suboptimal solution that is close to the shortest possible superstring.
> - The function is designed to handle a moderate number of strings efficiently. However, its performance might degrade with a very large number of strings due to the exponential growth of the DP table.
