> Joda-Time is a Java library designed to improve the handling of dates and times in Java. Before the introduction of the `java.time` package in Java 8, Joda-Time was the de facto standard for date and time manipulation in Java. It offers a comprehensive and user-friendly API for managing dates, times, durations, intervals, and chronologies, addressing many of the shortcomings of the older `java.util.Date` and `java.util.Calendar` classes.
>
> ### Key Features
> - **Immutability**: Most of the core classes in Joda-Time are immutable, which makes the library safe for use in multithreaded applications and helps avoid common bugs associated with date/time manipulation.
> - **Rich API for Date and Time Manipulation**: Provides classes like `DateTime`, `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `Interval`, `Duration`, and `Period` for expressing and manipulating date and time values more intuitively.
> - **Time Zone Support**: Extensive support for time zones, making it easier to work with dates and times across different time zones.
> - **Chronology Support**: Support for different calendar systems (Chronologies), such as ISO, Gregorian, Julian, and Buddhist calendars.
> - **Format and Parse**: Offers a comprehensive formatting and parsing framework that's both flexible and easy to use.
>
> ### Core Classes
> - `DateTime`: Represents an instant in time, with time zone.
> - `LocalDate`: Represents a date without time (year-month-day) in the ISO calendar system.
> - `LocalTime`: Represents a time without a date (hour-minute-second-millisecond) in the ISO calendar system.
> - `Interval`: Represents an interval of time from one instant to another instant.
> - `Duration`: Represents a duration of time measured in milliseconds.
> - `Period`: Represents a period of time defined in terms of fields such as years, months, and days, rather than milliseconds.
>
> ### Availability and Alternatives
> - Joda-Time is available to include in projects via Maven/Gradle dependencies.
> - With the introduction of the `java.time` package in Java 8, which was inspired by Joda-Time and designed by the same author, the need for Joda-Time has decreased for projects targeting Java 8 or later. However, Joda-Time remains popular, particularly for projects that must remain compatible with Java versions prior to Java 8.
