> ### `generateMSR` Function Specification
>
> #### Description
> The `generateMSR` method is designed to calculate the meal service requirements (MSR) for a flight based on various parameters such as the aircraft model, changes in the number of crew members and pilots, the number of child passengers, and the number of requested bundles of flowers.
>
> #### Method Signature
> ```java
> public MSR generateMSR(String aircraftmodel, String changeinthenumberofcrewmembers, int newnumberofcrewmembers, String changeinthenumberofpilots, int newnumberofpilots, int numberofchildpassengers, int numberofrequestedbundlesofflowers)
> ```
>
> #### Parameters
> - `aircraftmodel`: A `String` representing the model of the aircraft.
> - `changeinthenumberofcrewmembers`: A `String` indicating whether there is a change in the number of crew members (`"y"` for yes, `"n"` for no).
> - `newnumberofcrewmembers`: An `int` representing the new number of crew members if there is a change.
> - `changeinthenumberofpilots`: A `String` indicating whether there is a change in the number of pilots (`"y"` for yes, `"n"` for no).
> - `newnumberofpilots`: An `int` representing the new number of pilots if there is a change.
> - `numberofchildpassengers`: An `int` representing the number of child passengers on the flight.
> - `numberofrequestedbundlesofflowers`: An `int` representing the number of requested bundles of flowers.
>
> #### Returns
> - An instance of `MSR` containing the calculated meal service requirements for the flight.
>
> #### Logic
> 1. **Initialization**: Sets default values for the number of seats in first, business, and economic classes, as well as the default number of crew members and pilots based on the aircraft model.
> 2. **Updates**: Updates the number of crew members and pilots if there are changes indicated.
> 3. **Calculations**:
>     - Calculates the number of meals required for each class by multiplying the number of seats by 2.
>     - Calculates the number of meals for crew members and pilots in the same manner.
>     - Stores the number of child meals based on the number of child passengers multiplied by 2.
>     - Records the number of requested bundles of flowers directly from the input.
> 4. **Returns** an `MSR` object populated with the calculated values.
>
> #### Notes
> - The function dynamically adjusts to different aircraft models by changing the service parameters accordingly.
> - Changes in the number of crew members or pilots are accounted for only if indicated by the caller.
> - The method assumes valid input for the aircraft model and change indicators. Invalid or unrecognized inputs may result in the generation of an `IOException` that isn't thrown but could lead to incorrect MSR calculations or default processing.
