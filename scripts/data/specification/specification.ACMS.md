> ### `feeCalculation` Function Specification
>
> #### Description
> The `feeCalculation` method is designed to calculate the fee associated with luggage for an airline's baggage billing service. It calculates this fee based on the air class, geographical area, student status, luggage weight, and a base economic fee.
>
> #### Signature
> ```java
> public double feeCalculation(int airClass, int area, boolean isStudent, double luggage, double economicfee)
> ```
>
> #### Parameters
> - `airClass` (int): The class of the airline ticket, used to determine the luggage benchmark weight.
> - `area` (int): The geographical area code which affects the allowed luggage weight and additional conditions such as student benefits.
> - `isStudent` (boolean): Indicates if the passenger is a student, which can affect the luggage benchmark.
> - `luggage` (double): The weight of the luggage.
> - `economicfee` (double): The base economic fee rate used in the luggage fee calculation.
>
> #### Returns
> - `double`: The calculated luggage fee based on the given parameters.
>
> #### Logic
> 1. **Preprocessing Inputs**: The air class and area parameters are preprocessed using `preairclass` and `prearea` methods respectively, to normalize their values within expected ranges.
> 2. **Benchmark Setting**: Based on the air class, a benchmark luggage weight is set. This benchmark is further adjusted for students in certain areas.
> 3. **Luggage Allowance**: The method calculates the allowed luggage weight (`takealong`) and the number of allowed luggage (`tln`) based on the air class and area.
> 4. **Fee Calculation**: If the luggage weight exceeds the benchmark, the fee is calculated based on the difference between the actual luggage weight and the benchmark, multiplied by the economic fee rate and a factor of 0.015.
>
> #### Notes
> - The `preairclass` method normalizes the airClass input by calculating `airClass % 4`, ensuring it falls within a range of 0-3.
> - The `prearea` method normalizes the area input by calculating `area % 2`, ensuring it is either 0 or 1.
> - The calculation assumes that the luggage weight should at least match the benchmark before any fee is applied. If the luggage is lighter than the benchmark, it is considered to meet the benchmark for fee calculation purposes.
> - This method uses a fixed factor (`0.015`) to determine the final fee from the excess luggage weight and the economic fee rate, implying a linear relationship between excess weight and the fee charged.
